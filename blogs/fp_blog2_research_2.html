                            Alongside conducting workshops and testing ideas, there was quite a lot of reading to understand the already discovered concepts related to my topic. It includes the connection between emotions and the body through existing movement-based theories, awareness
                            about the lived body, interoception and soma, and the factors influencing our movements and behavior. Some interesting insights and evidence are stated below from my literature review.

                        <p class="text-justify">This questions why we describe only certain experiences as embodied experiences from our daily lives like immersive art exhibitions/ experiences, etc. They sure do make me feel different bodily, feel immersed, or internal. But,
                            what about the other kind of regular routine experiences, say drinking a cup of coffee? Even as I drink coffee, I feel energized, active, awakened, and even merrier. So, aren’t these also emotions attached to my body?

                        <p class="text-justify">This led me to ‘Interoceptions’, which are our sense of the internal state of the body, that’s both conscious and unconscious (‘Interoception’, 2022). Studies show that sensitivity to interoceptive signals can determine our capacity
                            to regulate emotions. The most common examples of interoceptive signals are feeling hungry or thirsty and how we respond to it by intaking food or water to satisfy the sensation.

                                <li>3 selective participants (well-known people) were chosen to try the workshop.</li>
                                <li>Participants wore masks that covered their heads, but they could see from behind their masks.</li>
                                <li>They were left alone, in an empty, almost dark room for about 12 minutes. For the first 6 minutes, they were accompanied by varying instrumental music, while the rest of the time, they were left alone in silence.</li>
                                <li>They were not guided or asked to move in any way, it was up to them to be the way they want to be.</li>
                                <li>A small verbal introduction on ‘connecting with our body and expressing the feelings’ was read aloud to the participant before the music began to set some context.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The fact of hiding the face in an empty room did allow the mind to only focus on themselves, their movements, and the body.</li>
                            <li>The prolonged 12 minutes helped them to feel comfortable and trust the space, as time passed. It also helped shift focus on their bodies.</li>
                            <li>The space allowed them to pay attention to the body. This lets them feel the muscle strain and pain and is reacted by stretching their body. This was repeatedly seen in all the participants at some point in the course.</li>
                            <li>There was no thinking about how to move the body, it was free-flowing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-justify">Participants described their movements in such a space as ‘random movements’ while sharing their experiences. But, it made me question the,</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Why do we do such random movements on a stage like this?</li>
                            <li>What is coming out of these random movements? Are they really random? Is it unique to an individual or is there a pattern?</li>
                            <li>What makes you move in such random ways that you don’t want others to see?</li>
                            <li>What do you benefit from these random movements?</li>
