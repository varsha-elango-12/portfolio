                            This brief got me spinning as soon as I heard it. It sounded quite tricky and unfair initially. It only got better as the IBM partners, Tom, Charlie and Scott detailed out the core and extended nuance of the brief. My team and I began the discussion over
                            lunch. Slowly seeping into the thoughts around the brief, there was hardly anyone talking. It was a tough one, we knew it. Bea and I talked about how few bank apps like Monzo categorize the purchase details into segments like
                            food, education, shopping, etc for the user to have a consolidated review each month. In a way, it benefits the user automatically without them realizing it ahead. This helped us gain existing examples around the brief and
                            we decided to kickstart post weekend.

                            We began brainstorming words related to the brief on Miro that helped us to screen through all aspects around the brief. We then used the process of questioning in terms of ‘What if’ to ideate concepts. I had suggested an idea of harvesting energies from
                            digital transactions to power communities, which we began to explore further. Along with this, we were interested in other ideas like how digital transactions can help non-humans, biomaterials, the elderly, and women with unfair
                            taxes on sanitary products, etc. We also had ideas to push CAPTCHA further where there is a secondary cause for verifications in digital transactions.

                            Having these, we presented them to the class on Thursday to receive feedback. One of our directions had an example of a design solution against tampon tax where the tampons were sold with a book package as books had lower taxes, and this kind of intervening
                            in the system and questioning unfairness was encouraged by the class and our tutors, nudging us to explore further.

                            The drawback with the energy harvesting idea was that with minimal energy dissipated in transactions, ‘what if the energy used to generate is higher than what we get back from it? ’ Partners from IBM also had similar feedback to our ideas and encouraged
                            us to approach the brief more specific than general.

                            We began Week 2 with a workshop on Design Ethnography, conducted by Wan. We spoke about how Design Ethnography can help finding insights, design opportunities, etc from culture studies and briefly attempted its process. The method suggests us to get into
                            the shoes of who we are designing for. Thus, to address our IBM brief, my team and I took our ATM cards for a coffee purchase from a coffee shop and observed different factors along the journey. As we noted down different observations
                            alongside digital transactions at the coffee place, we came back to synthesize these data and draw insights out of it. Most of our research suggested that we think of how the physical card transforms into different roles in
                            terms of shape, size, color, physical and technical abilities, etc for the user in different situations. We made quick sketches on a big sheet and presented them to the class. It was a fast and fun exercise and overall, a refreshing
                            workshop.

                            While getting back to our project, we focused on finding loopholes in different systems around us and kept the energy harvest idea aside. We began questioning which elements of a system can make us angry. Not to be surprised, each of us kept a lot coming
                            out from our personal experiences with varying systems.

                            As we kept pouring out, we came across the concept of contracts and subscription plans that keeps one tied up for a long period and not all resources given by the company are utilized fully by the user. For example, how a mobile data plan always has left
                            over data that’s unused, or how a coffee subscription plan of 5 drinks a day from a popular coffee chain in the UK has 1-2 drinks a day being unused, etc. We noticed the pattern of two people secretly sharing one coffee subscription
                            for those who don't drink more than 2 coffees a day. Even then, sometimes 1-2 drinks are left unused in one subscription. We decided to take advantage of this unused drink by sharing it to someone else in need without involving
                            the company. To be specific with our target group, we designed a system that can collect these unused drinks from the public and share them with the homeless or people in need. We generated a temporary QR Code for the original
                            QR given by the coffee company and also tested it at the store, it worked perfectly fine. The image below explains the structure of this system working.

                            To present the same to class, we enacted the whole scene of this system in action, by role-playing the characters. It was very well appreciated as it did serve the brief right. The constructive feedback was to involve the right set of audience and keep
                            it more directed and not as open-ended as ‘Homeless’, as this could be very hard to focus. The branding element in the solution was not convincing as it’s more to do subtly underground, where the awareness about such a system
                            should be kept low so that it’s not massively used by the people where the companies might get to know. We were also encouraged to translate this idea of intervention onto other similar areas to expand the scope. Taking this
                            advice, we moved on to Week 3.

                            We began jotting down similar systems to intervene to scale up our initial concept. We had a lot of brain-dumping that dragged up to two days. Out of a lot, utilizing the unused student discounts by a non-student interested us much. We liked how a parent,
                            sibling or a friend of a student uses the student discounts, offers, etc the student gets and how the companies are not completely aware or can’t really complain about this behavior. We wanted to push this existing attitude
                            of sharing or exchanging an unused benefit to more than family or friends, say strangers and maybe get back something in return. We began to decode this concept. We reached out to more people through google form to gather similar
                            examples of intervening in the system. The responses validated the examples we already had and hardly anything more. We were struggling to move ahead as we were not sure what our next step could be. Being the mid-week of the
                            project, the exhaustion had already begun amongst us.

                            My group and I took part in the ‘Dancing about money’ workshop conducted by Al and John to refresh ourselves and get new perspectives. The workshop focused on the attributes of money more than its physical nature but emotions around it. It pushed us to
                            think about materializing and dematerialising things around us and how much money has evolved in it. We had a crash assignment to pick one element from our wallets to anticipate what it could possibly re-materialize into while
                            holding on to its emotional values. My group picked a college ID card and transformed it into a personalized tattoo that each one can have. It was an exciting assignment that refreshed our brains too.

                            Getting back to our project, we decided to stick with sharing the student discounts amongst non-students and building a community around it. We were thinking in terms of a website to approach it. During tutorials, our tutors liked the concept of sharing
                            student discounts but strongly disagreed with a formal straight forward approach like a website. They encouraged us to still explore in an underground secret way to achieve this concept like how we intervened in the coffee
                            subscription system earlier.
