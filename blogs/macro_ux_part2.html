                            Having had the response to keep it raw and underground, we tied it back to some of such directions we previously had. We brought back the coffee subscription sharing idea and established it within the college to narrow down a specific community involved
                            in it. We saw this as an opportunity to evolve an honor system within a community.

                            The response was quite surprising. The system slowly began to function as 2 -3 people used it in a day as they saw it while passing by the poster. We didn’t promote or market it on any platform to purposely keep it slow in process to match the existing
                            speed of the sharing codes. We had included a feedback chart beside the poster to let people express their feeling about this in the form of symbols and ‘hearts’ were drawn repeatedly by the users.

                            To take this concept forward, we planned on expanding this concept to the general public in public places. We used the ‘Business Origami’ research method to understand the physical representation of the systematic design we were coming up with. It helped
                            us visualize the possible connections, interplays or movement that can exist in the system. We also realized we could have multiple outcomes for our brief as it’s a set of action plans that can address the brief, not essential
                            building one formal higher-end system. We had three kinds of outcomes addressing the same concept but at different levels. Thus, we split into two sub-groups to work efficiently in coming up with three outcomes.

                            During our tutorials after presenting our ideas, the tutors advised us to focus on one idea, the graffiti art of QR codes, which was not mainstream but underground with potential to create a counter-culture as our core concept has that character within
                            it. Prototyping the website and the geolocation idea was not feasible to execute in a week’s time considering its technical requirements, so we kept it for future. John suggested looking at chalk-spray which is easily erasable
                            and that could add on to expiration of these codes as time passes.

                            Carefully considering the feedback, we focused on executing the graffiti idea and planned the details. To begin with sharing codes, we picked the subscription of the popular coffee chain in the UK and the student discount of a well-known pharmaceutical
                            company in the UK as both of these include QR/Barcodes codes, which were easy to be shared. Our idea was to spray paint QR codes, which when scanned, takes the user to either of the two chosen offers and the user could use
                            them according to the instructions provided within each form. To prototype this, we used Google forms to organize the sharing as it was the immediately feasible technical solution.

                            We chose to illustrate hearts around the QR to mark a sign of identity, informal, and relatable. Also expecting people to add more hearts as they begin to use it. Red color paint which can stand out bold and attractive. We laser cut the QR to make our
                            stencil and painted it at Leake Street.

                            My group and I shared the action on social media which gained a lot of attention and responses, which in a way, began the growth of this system as ‘word of mouth’. We purposely chose to keep the growth slow from one person to another as it’s more of creating
                            a counter culture, off mainstream and underground. We did get feedback from people using the QR at the rate of one-two per day, which we saw as the success of the system. In the future, we anticipate this system expanding bigger
                            where people can share various other unused benefits as QR codes across different locations, but maintaining its style, colors, and improvising to their own styles.

                            We documented the whole process of execution and presented the film to the class on the final presentation day. The tangible quality of the output, along with keeping it off the mainstream was quite appreciated. The constructive feedback included how
                            we could have included the system growth, say people sharing this with others in the video to relate better. Our way of presentation directly hit the solution before setting a foreground and that left some new faces in the
                            audience with lack of clarity as it was the first time they were looking at our project. So, understanding our audience before the presentation was a big learning for us.
