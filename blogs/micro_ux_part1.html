                            Once again, a very shady-sounding brief I was assigned, which was out of the world for me to even consider working on. But, it was the kind of challenge and attitude I wanted to acquire to attempt such niche briefs.

                            We started off assigning our own smaller groups of 4 from a large group of 12. This was the first time in MA UX, students were making their own groups. To keep it professional and efficient, we split groups based on our strengths and weaknesses equally
                            balanced across all small teams of 4. My group and I began by brainstorming all possible words related to the brief to help us get into the topic from our past knowledge.

                            Simultaneously, we began secondary research, where we browsed across varied topics associated with our brief. Our research included the uses of different human bodily fluids from past to present, current data on the exchange of such fluids, legal and
                            illegal transfers, etc. Alongside research, there raised curious questions and random ideas amongst us, which were being documented to ponder upon later.

                            We picked a specific reason to exchange each time like buying urine for farming purposes, for fetish reasons, for a drug test, etc. We realized that the flow was very similar to that of a bicycle, besides some additional requirements in terms of reliability
                            on the person and validation of the product exchanged. Along with this, there were quantity and quality considerations based on different usages. With all these findings, we kept ideating ways to intervene in the flow and reinforce

                            As she walked in and around the campus, nobody from the public even cautiously noticed nor bothered. Only my teammate was bothered as we all knew it was her pee. Later, while entering back into LCC, the security stopped us and questioned if it was alcohol
                            that she was holding!!! We controlled our laughs, denied that it was not alcohol, and walked away. We realized that keeping it a transparent cup made it uncomfortable for the user but made no difference for common people.

                            Moving ahead, we came up with the idea of “Wee pays Van”, a moving automobile, catering to multiple usages of urine, to be sponsored by Gumtree, where one can pee and get paid for it. All the urine can be collected and stored together and shipped to farmers,
                            industries, etc where they require in large quantities. This van can also sell to individual buyers based on orders placed on the website. Collecting multiple urines and mixing them before a sale can prevent the usage of pure
                            urine for drug tests too. Thus, this idea can cater to C2C and C2B2C.

                            We enacted the possible scenario of this idea to the class during the presentation. Our constructive feedback was to get micro(zoom in) in terms of dealing the exchange rather than staying macro (zoom out). To focus on staying C2C as it's the existing
                            model of Gumtree. John suggested we narrow it down to one scenario, say, an exchange of urine for a drug test, as the trust value is at its maximum to be explored in such a case. We had also failed to analyze, synthesize and
                            extrapolate the data gained from 'The Pee experiment', which was suggested by our tutors to get back on.

                            Considering zooming into the C2C scenario of interaction, we went back to closely analyzing the 'Pee experiment' from the past week. We drew out insights and pain points from collecting and moving around with one's own urine, which is primarily the seller's
                            journey. Having synthesized these, I realize now that we didn't put to use the analysis, but rather shifted our focus to building trust for the buyer. We had also closely studied the existing features on the Gumtree website
                            individually, but again, didn't pull out the crux of our findings apart from sharing verbally with the rest of the team. We jumped on and picked a scenario of buying urine by a police officer for his drug test at the workplace
                            as suggested by John. As we storyboarded the possible scenario of interaction, some of the initial trust values of picking the right person, deciding on the time of the meeting, etc were being sorted on the Gumtree app, but
                            the trust in the purity of the urine was unsolved digitally. To enable the testing of urine while buying, we designed a container that allows a simple and comfortable way of checking the purity of the urine.

                            Having felt stuck or still not confident about our approaches, we attended the workshop by Hayley on synthesizing, validating, and critically analyzing data obtained from various research processes. During our session with Hayley, she suggested we closely
                            observe the similar models that work on trust that involve digital and physical interactions. While examining such kinds, I found the pattern of trusting a product based on past customer reviews, ratings, photographs, etc to
                            be a repetitive and a major factor in almost all sites.

                            Considering the idea of trusting the previous customer blindly just because they are both the same product buyers, it was interesting to push this further in our case in terms of what kind of review system, how specific can the rating be, etc. We really
                            felt the evolving scope in this area and wanted to dig deeper. Also, existing Gumtree works on buying after checking the product in person in most cases.

                            These findings were presented on the next review day. Unfortunately, I had to miss the session due to my health malfunctioning, but my group managed it well. We were appreciated for the analysis chart drawn out for the 'Pee Experiment'. The networking
                            idea was not quite clearly communicated to the bunch. The feedback was mostly to make a high-fidelity prototype of the testing container and document a particular scenario of exchange including all our design elements in it.
