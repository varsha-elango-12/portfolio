                            Never in my life have I consciously thought about whether boredom is helping me, until today. As I started thinking, I can relate and pick so many values that boredom can actually provide me. The project began with my new group involving Amber, Michelle
                            and I who were present in the class to start with, while Lara was sick and Boxin was back in China, preparing to join us soon in-person. The three of us started off with ‘Directed storytelling’, one of the research methods
                            that we had to use for this project. We interviewed each other and jotted down interesting feedback or insights from each of our experiences. We updated Lara and Boxin over whatsapp and kept them informed about our journey.
                            We interviewed both of them virtually the next day with directed storytelling and got a couple other insights. Over the weekend, we narrowed down to the values we felt to be strong, convincing, and effective to be communicated.
                            Those were, how boredom tells us to have a change of action, choices, etc, how it allows us to spend self-time with ourselves to have self-reflections and thoughts, how it helps to discover the hidden talents or creativity
                            and how it gives us the rest needed for our brain to function better later.

                            On Monday, we started ideating how to convey the picked values. While Boxun was still virtually connected, Lara was fine and back in college. As we kept ideating, we were struggling to translate the ideas to materials or actions. It took us more time
                            to jot down a few ideas and planned to prototype the next day at college. One of them was to show the situational boredom we get from time to time. It was to make a collective group of people draw circles 3-4 times on a sheet
                            of paper and then ask them to flip the sheet to draw anything among a circle/square/ triangle. It’s to test if in a matter of a minute, they get bored of repetition and move towards a change, say drawing a square/ triangle
                            and not a circle. It was so effective while we tested with some volunteers. Although it was one of the simplest ideas, since it was conveying the purpose, we thought of presenting this to the class on the mid-presentation day.

                            When we presented on Thursday, there were different responses. While most of them chose to draw different shapes because they were bored of circles, some were trying to build something using the shapes itself like houses etc, while others still wanted
                            to draw a circle to perfection. When we collected the sheets back to introspect, we realized how so many of them had doodles/scribbles on the sheet as a result of boredom/ or doing something unconsciously while we were presenting
                            in the class. It was interesting but then we felt that the concept was a bit shallow by direct representation. We had to get deeper in the value we were conveying.

                            Going back to our list of identified values, we picked the value of self-reflection or value of discovery from the existential boredom to be conveyed in the final presentation. We ideated on how to present the chosen topics. There were ideas like personification
                            of boredom as a character and an act between the person and his/her boredom. Another one to present a person with questions they think of when they are bored, stuck on a mirror and they have to peel it off when they have answers
                            to them, while the unanswered questions leave a distorted reflection of the user behind, ending up with both clear and distorted images of them. Last one was to let the users punch holes on a sheet randomly for 2 minutes, and
                            when that sheet of paper passes through a music box, it creates music, which compares the analogy of how random things we do during boredom can end up in discovering yourself and the hidden creativity. Since it was difficult
                            to enact the characterization idea amongst us in a short duration of time, we prototyped the other two.

                            Our volunteers were able to connect with the activities very well and provided us with relatable feedback and thoughts. We were so satisfied with both ideas and that left us confused to choose one amongst the two for the final presentation. After a long
                            argument, we decided to show the mirror idea as one of our explorations during the process. As it is a very personal one, engaging the whole class at once might be difficult, hence we chose the music idea to be done in the
                            class with everyone involved.

                            On the day of presentation, we asked three volunteers to punch holes while the rest of the class observed them. As they finished punching holes, we confused the class by talking amongst ourselves about how beautiful the holes looked and then finally revealed
                            how they created beautiful music. Also played the recorded music from the previous day on speakers with lights turned off to give an immersive experience for everyone. Everyone enjoyed it and gave great feedback. People were
                            convinced with the concept coming out neat, simple, gentle and involving multiple senses. We were really glad and it was a happy ending.

                                    I realized the necessity to make quick prototypes that can make things much clearer rather than a long conversation, which helped in our week 2’s presentation.

                                <li>
                                    I was able to see how keeping an idea simple with less elements involved can help users focus more on the essence of the concept than suffocating with multiple things at a time.
