                            The class was already flooding with people wearing yellow and it instantly cheered my mind. My team and I started off brainstorming references from our own cultural backgrounds and knowledge. May pointed out an exhibition named Joy at Wellcome museum
                            which had major use of yellow (Joy, 2022). To gain insight and do an artefact analysis, we visited the exhibition on Monday morning. Among the many installations on Joy, one of them had a yellow filter over a reaction-less
                            dance/ action, which changed a monotonous action into an act of joy with energy. There was another exhibition on Tranquillity, which recreated an immersive experience of being in a rainforest using photographs, sounds, smell
                            and light. With manipulation in the pixel quality, the photographs felt like a real tree. I personally didn't want to leave that room as the experience was so serene to my mind and body.

                            As we left this beautiful exhibition, it took me sometime to come back to reality. We then stopped at a cafe to ideate on the brief and meet Alaistair for tutorials. Kyle’s idea of presenting multiple yellows to a user and letting them connect with their
                            own interpretations was encouraged by Alaistair to explore deeper. While internally discussing, we felt the input was incomplete. Later, another idea struck me, ‘How would you convey the colour yellow to another person without
                            actually showing the yellow?’ (like explaining colours to a blind person). When I shared it with my group, it got exciting as we thought of using body movements, sounds, emotions, etc to put forth the character of yellow. We
                            decided to test both ideas for week 1.

                            The group split to prototype two ideas. For idea two, we created a room where the person goes in, picks a rule card (movements, sound, tactile, feeling and visuals) and uses that to convey yellow to an imaginary friend, with objects part of the creative
                            tool kit. The tool kit had things like rice in a box, iron rods, wooden sticks, papers, cardboard, sketch pens, etc to create their own sounds, drawings, actions etc. The results were interesting, fun and spontaneous. Simultaneously,
                            for idea one, different sheets of yellow were stuck on a board. The user can draw/ write anything they relate with a particular shade on a transparent sheet and pin it over the yellow. Behind each shade, there was a QR code
                            that conveys the actual meaning of the yellow while scanned.

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Both the ideas were presented to the class. While idea 1 was executed live in class, the results of idea 2 was screened on the tv. There was mixed feedback. Idea 1‘s experience of being surrounded by yellow was effective but associating it with specific
                            things was subjective and close-ended. While idea 2 was explorative, we could pick better objects that let the user express much freely. The overall experience for the viewer was also missing out. Our tutorials with John and
                            Tonicha had the same set of arguments.

                            By trying to combine the pros of both ideas, we came up with idea three. The idea was to generate different shades of yellow automatically to different set of sounds or movements a person made. To present this, we decided to suspend huge white curtains
                            from the ceiling to the floor in front of the user. There would be a yellow light projected on the curtain, changing its shades based on the varying sounds and movements of the person. We generally relate low pitched sound
                            with dull yellows while shouting, loud sounds with bright and light yellows. To understand the cognition behind it, we researched to find that there exists a phenomenon called synaesthesia, where a person can associate a stimulus
                            of one sensory activity into an involuntary action in another sense (CARPENTER, 2001). Chromesthesia is of such a kind where a person can associate a sound with a colour and they tend to relate dull colour with low pitch and
                            vice versa. It has been proven that even a person without synaesthesia feels the same (Wikipedia contributors, 2021). On that note, we programmed our code similarly to generate different yellows.

                            With a lot to achieve in a short time, we split our work for easy management. While Farah, Bea and I took the responsibility to develop the code, the rest were involved in setting up the screens, projectors, etc. The CTL Lab instructors guided us to figure
                            out the code. Fortunately, my boyfriend from India is a software developer and he helped us to figure things out quickly. We managed to pull it off faster than we expected and experimented with the outputs. We focused just
                            on sound inputs as creating movements can also produce sounds and combining both was getting complicated. Meanwhile, the others suspended curtains and set the stage up. By Wednesday evening, we had everything ready and the
                            results were as desired. We were so excited for the final day.

                            To explore the variety of sounds possible with varying motion, we had specifically picked volunteers to sing, dance, talk etc. Mita, Faiza, Kristen and Desire did a wonderful job, where the idea was communicated to the audience so effectively and the
                            whole experience of doing and viewing was amazing. The feedback was quite positive and we were well appreciated for the whole output. The entire journey for me with my group was very affirmative, and we believed in each other

                                    When designing the creative tool kit, I realised how the objects and materials we provide for the user shouldn’t be restrictive or forcing rather flexible to let them express best.

                                    I was able to learn and generate the creative code and it worked perfect for this project.
