                            Being the term’s final brief, I was personally very excited about this brief as I love paper for its utmost flexibility to expressing oneself. My new team and I connected online on Monday to brainstorm and dumped all our thoughts about paper. We picked
                            two ideas that all of us found interesting. Those were to explore its physical properties and how paper documents are a sign of authenticity or proof. Aiqin proposed an idea of futuristic paper with dried leaves and we decided
                            to explore and prototype it along with other selected ideas the next day in college.

                            While we met at college, with new ideas popping in, we kept exploring everything and moving ahead until we had something concrete. One of them was to make musical instruments out of paper to create a fun gig in class. With the insights from the bodystorming
                            exercise, we made working prototypes of a few instruments. But then, the question of why paper instruments when the regular instruments work perfectly fine was something we had no answer to. We were skeptical about taking it
                            forward.

                            We restarted ideation. We liked the idea of paper being the proof of identity or how it adds value to a person in the form of a certificate, ID Card, paper works etc. While using bodystorming, the example of money or currency stuck with us. Mita suddenly
                            mentioned the concept of future money to be time that we trade with, inspired from the film, ‘In time’. We were blown about the idea of futuristic currency and it was already Wednesday evening. With limited research, we decided
                            to perform a skit on Thursday showing a day in a student’s life when money is replaced with time. As Parth and I were planning the skit, Mita simultaneously designed the time currency notes and got them printed. We also planned
                            to present the paper instruments to the class and get opinions on both the concepts for the final week.

                            The skit had four scenes with Parth being the student from LCC. Scene one- Parth woke up for college, realized that he ran short of time and borrowed from me, a flatmate. He then ran to a tube ride without showering as he had no time. Scene two- Parth
                            reached LCC right on time for the group presentation. Scene three- He got credited with time for his part time work and felt relieved about not being short of time. Scene four- He invited two classmates (volunteers) for dinner
                            at a restaurant. The food was priced high if it took more time to be made and vice versa. They spent good quality time together over the dinner table. The end of the skit.

                            scenario and explore deeper to create impact. John and Tonicha suggested the same during the tutorials.

                            We used the literature review method to study the topic more. I wrote on the concept of paper currency’s journey by reading two internet articles (Beattie, 2021) (Ritchie, 2009). In a nutshell, history being very clear as a shift in barter system to making
                            transfers easier, light weight, and the concept of receipt being shared as an evidence finally got paper notes into play. My opinion from the past trend to the future trend is as follows.

                            Value of a product/system is always negotiable as the base/equation we hold in exchange for the product/service is money whose value isn’t fixed. Currency notes take the shape and value of money only when the government authorizes it and hence is the
                            fiat money. The Government decides the value of the notes, it’s active period and design. They even keep changing the design of the notes to prevent counterfeit. Money as an element doesn’t have a form nor can be touched/smelt.
                            But when coins, paper notes, cards, objects, etc are presented as a form of money, they materialize.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify font-italic">
                            Value of money can change when the country experiences inflation. Thus currency notes can get active or inactive at any point in our lives. They are mere pieces of paper with a mortal life period. Existence of currency notes has already been overlooked
                            by digital/virtual currency, cryptocash, etc. What more can happen to transform the existing money?

                            Post weekend, we were still unsure if our literature review was helping to move ahead. We used the AEIOU research method and realized how characteristics of paper were fading off focusing into time. We discarded the old idea and picked the sentimental
                            value of envelopes and paper as an identity/value for a person to begin fresh.

                            We split our work to prototype various ideas before finalizing on one. For the sentimental value a certificate had, we had ideas of acknowledging the little gratitude we show in our lives with others through printed and written certificates. When we shared
                            these certificates amongst a few volunteers like an award, they felt very special, loving and acknowledged as it’s put on paper.

                            For the other idea of paper adding value to a person, we associated degree certificates, ID Cards, documents etc. Aiqin proposed an idea to present the back of a certificate to the user to express their feelings on different stages in a journey of receiving
                            a certificate, both good and bad, using various materials. Once expressed, we could flip the paper to reveal the certificate, hence showing all the hardships a person goes through to get that final piece of paper/reward. While
                            Aiqin and Fangue prototyped it with volunteers, it worked great with the little moments of surprise and deep realization too.

                            To present the same idea, Parth suggested writing all struggles on paper and sticking over boxes, big to small, similar to Russian dolls. As a person opens box after box, the questions would lead to self-introspection. With the majority of international
                            students in our class, the uncertain process of getting a visa to study would be relatable to most in class. The final box could hold the print of the visa. It could be a new journey to be part of for home students. We prototyped
                            with an international and home student, as they discussed the questions with each other, it was personal and heavy, and we were unsure if it would be good to present for the whole class.

                            I had then suggested combining Aiqin’s and Parth’s idea where we could print the visa in a big sheet and show the journey on the tv screen from getting the selection email from LCC to Visa interview email for the whole class to see. We could invite a
                            volunteer to come and express their feelings on the journey looking at the pictures on tv. Once done, we could reveal the visa and everyone can connect with the process. Everyone agreed on the final idea and we prepared for
                            the presentation.

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            During our presentation, not just the volunteer, but everyone looking at the TV was constantly reacting aloud to each image from their past memory. After we revealed the visa, it was a hard-hitting moment to see how much we had gone through for the final
                            piece of paper called visa. Our feedback was quite positive and emotional too. People appreciated the idea of showing the weight of a paper through journeys. Few suggested picking better materials for expressing feelings as
                            the provided materials were neither handy nor faster to express.

                                    Prioritizing ideas was important that we lacked as a group, hence trying too many ideas drained all our energy for the final idea and resulted in insufficient input for the output.
